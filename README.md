## Hi!

My name is Wei.

## 🖥∙☕️∙👩🏻‍🌾🤞∙🧗🏻‍

A little more about me:

- I am the developer sitting next to Chenchen and Kenrick.
- Coffee is my water.
- I'm the second girl developer in Shopee
- I'm better known in the company as "the one who does rock climbing"

## A bit of history...

This repo originated from my sharing on the [React Rally](http://reactrally.com) conference I went to. We could not find a meeting room that day, so we sneaked in a secret space in our company that turned out to work really well for sharings. So I took up the chance to expand our weekly sharing to a more organized form.

I'm still exploring this topic. But I am personally giving more talks as I prepare for our weekly sharing. So I am refactoring this repo to my general talks repo.
