# Trip RR Sharing

If you prefer to re-play the slides, clone this repo and do

```
$ yarn
$ yarn start
```

Otherwise a readup on this doc may be sufficient.

If you wish to talk or ask more about my sharing or conferences in general, you are welcome to create an issue to start a conversation on that.

## Hi!

My name is Wei.

## 🖥∙️☕️∙👩🏻‍🌾🤞∙🧗🏻‍

A little more about me:

- I am the developer sitting next to both Chenchen and Kenrick.
- Coffee is my water.
- I'm the second girl developer in Shopee
- I'm better known in the company as "the one who does rock climbing"

## Motivation

### Getting Sponsored

Beginning of this year, our team officially sponsors us to go to conferences with half coverage. You will need manager's approval so email your team lead to apply.

So I was like, company sponsored 🧗🏻‍?
I literally started looking for those places that I've never been to

### Conference Line-Ups

#### [React Finland](http://react-finland.fi/)

_Next one is May/June 2019_

Their website is really neat and cool.
They even have a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nREBeiaC0wc) of the whole coding process.
But before I made up my mind they're already sold out.

#### [ReactNext](http://react-next.com/)

_Tel Aviv, Israel. Nov 4 2018_

It must be a "once in a lifetime" experience to go to Israel.
I really wanted to go.
But the dates kept changing.

_(They confirmed not long ago, in fact, and they are lining up speakers. [Tickets](http://react-next.com/tickets) are still available at time of this talk.)_

#### [React Europe](https://www.react-europe.org/)

_Paris, France. May 23-24, 2019_

Already scheduled for next year. And they're [calling for paper](https://checkout.eventlama.com/#/events/reacteurope-2019/cfp) for workshops.

Then some of us went to React Europe. Check out [this guy](https://www.facebook.com/thien.tran.98478?fb_dtsg_ag=Ady0o5ZOTsIn6H94nAG2HcLcaquSx_4opVQ6wRVGLu2DhQ%3AAdw9zbWcj2kx6-IAItgXkpEHDw3HrvgBtrzUtMz9zxJPrA) on FB for more photos. Remember, `3/80`.

### JavaScript Fatigue

![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/7sThmP82L5v20/giphy.gif)

Then there was this period of time when i was really tired about what i was doing everyday.
There's a community term for that called _JavaScript fatigue_, but i'm not sure whether that was my syndrome.

Not sure about you guys but there was this period of time when I got really, really fed up with looking at this every day.

(No sensitive info cuz this photo is live version of https://shopee.sg. But was down.)

So I was doing the same features every day.
And I was unable to work on some of the more interesting things that all the cool developers were doing.
As some of you may know I was not a cs major. I tell people that I took a few CS classes, but I normally don't tell that I failed most of them.

### Get Well Soon!!!

Here is a quote that from an online algirothm class that i enrolled and it goes:

> There are two ways to become a good developer
>
> - code for 10 years
> - take an algorithm class

I'm definitely that 10 year one.

And then some of the features that I put a lot of effort to, some very carefully written merge requests for internal improvements.
I resolved all the discussion like seriously, and even prepared full set the test cases that I collected from QA.
But never got merged because apparently I was not good enough and my work was not important enough.
And then our team restructured and the feature was handed over to another developer.

> "Cannot merge because we have no qa resources"
>
> "Please prepare test cases and screenshots in your mr"

So I was really bored and sad and decided that I'll go to a conference and see what other front end developers are doing in this world.

And by that time the only one left this year was [React Rally](http://www.reactrally.com/).

But of course the tickets were all sold out.

So how did I ended up still going?

First I sent an email to ask about their waitlist. They replied that while the waitlist was first-come-first-serve (and normally would start to roll out really late), I could give a try to their _diversity scholarship_.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nQf6lwJbJX7I2Du0essX8iY6nivEfLycirNyL9xcbCq6nkR1IXMOhBOs8c3ZWfxRyqx7_L1A21AA0-3AlBx3afdbAbItFAldw1iQAUko4ys0qIgZfmXTSCwJNlPggC1OzIZS-GeeT-xgGuMOaaf_yhGuDCkG-oHqccYHY23N8-zxooXt8DJa-hNjEdUbW-P0dq-gkNalUK-kOUJiBKqkQKC2HO9O-TPih081dEofrjQiTmqA8gf22cHTbstQGEFR6JK2oGIScnayDxbrVu14vr0WeXAK5hYs6ImaOo7dvdsvNzTHmvnkyC7C__pmZ5XRP31reQdViWeFA0Qk8B1fsSnxG3mrZOPUTJHLtScjqawQd4TU3De30gU4qRLAe5PUdYn9sz46HvpbvvOYcUkdldFIp87wIk31Vwoah4IWsGMKX920lzjTL1jnvYiPzqs_O8KRyxV6-0TIYaw6H_LVkWsZ_egt78wrBkVz7QQv4oCHiz3tHmhbrP_mbjqug5uiU_-UlN7jOS4Xod3Z8MRgsI35tZ6K_t7yy783b8xciSS-0Lp0tbptW-QCcGjBaUldpcLhqx0K7031ZM1_I1WOhj6Wk7bBkP0BJ1izz9RY_htXCgPNeEkSFeGWy5ePnJw=w2114-h262-no)

Thinking that it wouldn't take me too much more than writing an essay, I decided to give it a shot.
And I summarized like what inside of me counts towards besing _diversified_:

- I'm flying in from Singapore
- I'm a girl, Asian, and not a computer science major
- I've worked and studied in the U.S., China, and SEA
- I do a shit loads of stuff other than web FE development (but everyone of us does this, tho)
  I am really diversified!

However, when the time came that I really _did_ get the diversity scholarship, I was quite thrilled.
Other than just a ticket itself, I think this little acceptance by the community made me feel quite warm and being welcomed.
So I would really encourage you to try proposing something to this community.
Even if you might or might not get recognized or awarded, the process itself would actually help you know more of yourself.

And I'm happy to be your ghost writer if you need one.
