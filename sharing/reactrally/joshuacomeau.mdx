# Explorable Explanations with React

He built [this](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/)

```notes
So simply put, this talk is about how he built this waveform presentation.
It's really awesome, you have to see it.
Other than showing how he built it, he shows and inspires people that:
- React is a good tool to build this kind of things, you build smaller pieces, and piece them together to something not only more complex, but complete and presentable.
- Throughout his showcase he also demonstrates attitudes from Sunil's talk and Michael Chan's talk:
  - First you make it work, then you make it nice, then you make it fast
  - Live code is gold, but code with good taste is composable, has good api, some hack is ok as long as you profile it and its hacky part does not leak out beyond its scope
- This is one of his side projects. But it's one that actually helped a lot of people understand waveforms. 
One of my favorite talks at RR.
It demonstrates creativity, proficiency of engineering, decency in code, love and passion about coding, react, and this world.
