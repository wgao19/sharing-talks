# Understanding the Bézier Curves

An Intuitive Approach

---

## Why Bézier Curves?

[Pierre Bézier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_B%C3%A9zier), an engineer at Renault, was looking for a tool to define curves.

- easy to parametrize
- easy to alter & control shape

curves defined by the Bézier curves are

```notes
another way to visualize it is to think of it as an "interpolation"
- leaving the starting point,
- while this force drives it to move towards this direction, this other point is driving it towards this direction
- finally concluding at the end point
```

Definitions on:

- coordinate systems
- vector spaces
- algebraic definition (with Bernstein polynomial)

Some more convenient than other depending on situations

```notes
There are very advanced mathematical theories that says they're all equivalent with each other
