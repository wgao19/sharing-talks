_Shawn Wang_

- React *can* be reactive, but it's not. Why is that?
- Because of the cost of rendering, because we want to do batching, because we do a push and pull scheduler (watch the talk to understand).

```notes
- Shawn is from Singapore
- Very contentful, proposes a mindset how we think about the React framework and the app that we build using React

> Why React is _not_ Reactive

- Reactive "data producers" v.s. imperative "data consumers" 
- React is v = f*(d$)

```notes
- continues to propose that "data producers" are meant to be reactive and "data consumers" (i.e. UI) are meant to be lazy and imperative
- v = f*(d$), where f is fiber scheduler, and d$ is data stream that is meant to be reactive

- Investigates and presents the idea thoroughly, incrementally brings audience to reach the conclusion
- Fluent talk, appealing jokes and humors
