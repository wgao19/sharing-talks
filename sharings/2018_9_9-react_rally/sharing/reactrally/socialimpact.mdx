```notes
Two of the talks stressed social impact.

- Real-world use cases in React, especially in underdeveloped fields and areas.
- maybe talk about USDS?

Sophia Shoemaker:
- creating offline application (pwa) with React

Carrie Maxwell:
- mind an explosive start
- they managed to run a hackathon throughout hurricanes harvey and iris, and built a number of apps & helped with the situation

A sharing from a personal perspective is that this is a very typical American thing.
There are a lot of projects going on aiming at helping underdeveloped regions and underrepresented groups of people. 
They are typically run by very few people, with very limited funding, overcoming tremendous barriers and difficulties.
By hearing their talk you feel they are very capable people, both intellectually and emotionally strong.
I am in essence very happy to be able to hear their voice at a conference like this.
