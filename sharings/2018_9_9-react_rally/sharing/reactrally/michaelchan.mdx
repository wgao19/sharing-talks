# Clean Code is Dead

Michael Chan

- ✊ pliable
- 👆 composable
- ✌️ reasonable
- 🖖 removable

Also a "must-watch".
Besides his truly genuine and emotionally expressive storytelling that you all are going to love, he speaks up for what is living code.
It is not reasonable to strive for extreme cleanliness and DRY, what matters is that our code ships.

But he is not saying that there is no good virtue about code.
And he suggests these four to be what we should think about:

- it is flexible, you can reach for where you need to make changes to without much hairpulling
- it is composable, achieve functionality by reorganizing building blocks
- it is reasonably performant and (and not unreasonably DRY)
- it is removable when you realize it is wrong

# 👩🏻‍🌾 & 🌽 & 💩

I like his analogy of the nature of our job. 
We're not builders who build architectures that will stand there for 100 years.
We are farmers.
Farmers work on living things.
And there is shit in there, get it :)
