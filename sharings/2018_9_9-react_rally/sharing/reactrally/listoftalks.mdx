```notes

all very down-to-earth talks that address some of the real day-to-day issues we encounter

- the first talk says chaos is normal in our industry
  - classic example: internationalization
- the second talk says just ship code (superb storytelling btw)
- the third talk says there's still hope (nice talks by kent c dodds, clear, humerous, patient and nice)

- gives a hint of how to improve our `ItemCard`?
