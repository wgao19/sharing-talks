## 🌰 Performance Optimizations with `mapStateToProps`

> React Redux takes care of the equality checks so that our apps don’t re-render when not necessary

---

- when do `mapStateToProps` functions run
- when do connected components re-render

---

### When do `mapStateToProps` functions run?

---

All connected components’ `mapStateToProps` runs whenever the store changes

---

<video controls autoPlay>
  <source src="./assets/mapState runs.mov" />
</video>

🙈 Take home: `mapStateToProps` functions should run as fast as possible.

---

### When do connected components re-render?

---

It depends on `mapState` return, i.e.:

```jsx
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  foo: "bar",
  bar: ownProps.bar,
  evil: { ...ownProps.evil }
});
```

---

<video controls autoPlay>
  <source src="./assets/re-renders.mov" />
</video>

---

put the striking shopee's home page re-render here

---

🙊 Take home: Only return new object references when needed

```js
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  myFavoriteThingOnAXmasTree: state.mistletoe,  // 💁🏻‍♀️
  myLeastFavorite: { ...state.jingleBell },     // 🙅🏻‍♀️
  { ...state.iroiro }, // this is tricky, you don't know for sure
});
```

```notes
This is where React Redux does work for us. We’ve already been taking advantages of React’s optimizations where only changed components are re-rendered. React Redux has aligned with that. Although each connected component receives the whole store state whenever the store changes, only component with updated merged props will re-render. This is further determined by a default equality function (`===` on each field of the mergedProps). You may define your own equality functions for customized optimization.
