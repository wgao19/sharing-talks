## 🌰 Performance Optimizations with `mapStateToProps`

---

> React Redux takes care of the equality checks so that our apps don’t re-render when not necessary

```notes
the store of our whole app is in one single object
each connected component will be notified whenever anything changes
```

---

- when do `mapStateToProps` functions run
- when do connected components re-render

```notes
two questions arise
```

---

### When do `mapStateToProps` functions run?

```notes
have u ever thought about...
```

---

All connected components’ `mapStateToProps` run whenever the store state changes

---

<video controls autoPlay loop>
  <source src="./assets/mapState runs.mov" />
</video>

---

<div style={{ width: "100vw", height: "100vh", overflowY: "scroll" }}>
  <img src="./assets/shopee.png" />
</div>

```notes
not a big deal unless of course if we're on this page
```

---

🙈 Take home: `mapStateToProps` functions should be fast, pure, and synchronous

```notes
i've put a console log in `mapState`
```

---

### When do connected components re-render?

---

It depends on `mapState` return, i.e.:

```jsx
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  foo: "bar",
  bar: ownProps.bar,
  evil: { ...ownProps.evil }
});
```

---

<video controls autoPlay loop>
  <source src="./assets/re-renders.mov" />
</video>

---

🙊 Take home: Only return new object references when needed

```js
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  myFavoriteThingOnAXmasTree: state.mistletoe,  // 💁🏻‍♀️
  myLeastFavorite: { ...state.jingleBell },     // 🙅🏻‍♀️
  { ...state.iroiro }, // this is tricky, you don't know for sure
});
```

```notes
react redux does the check for us
```

---

### recap `mapState`

- 🙊 should be fast, pure, and synchronous
- 🙈 return reference to new objects only when needed
