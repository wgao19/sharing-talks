## ðŸŒ° Declarative API

the _Object Shorthand_ of `mapDispatchToProps`

---

I hear there are two factions

---

export default Split;

`mapDispatch` is a function

`mapDispatch` is an object

---

`dispatch`, no?

---

_If you do not specify a `mapDispatch`, React Redux will give you `dispatch` by default_

- `connect()(MyComponent)`
- `connect(mapState)(MyComponent)`

```notes
let's find `dispatch`

_If you do not specify a `mapDispatch`, React Redux will give you `dispatch` by default_

but only when u don't specify mapdispatch

```

---

so that you can do

```jsx
<button onClick={props.dispatch({ type: "BUTTON_CLICK" })}>Click!</button>
```

<Appear>... but who does that?</Appear>

---

### `mapDispatchToProps` as a function

```jsx
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({
  // whatever you put here will be merged to your connected component as props
  onClick: () => dispatch({ type: "MY_CLICK_ACTION" })
});

const MyComponent = props => (
  <div onClick={props.onClick}>Click!</div>
  // note that the component is not seeing "dispatch"
  // all it knows is props has an onClick callback
);

export default connect(
  null,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(MyComponent);
```

component is no longer seeing `dispatch` ðŸ™ˆ

```notes
first look at the function form

here you're suppose to write your return (normally referred to as dispatch props)
as functions, calling which should dispatch an action

because you've wrapped that dispatch in the closure, you no longer need to use `dispatch` in your component

```

---

the _"original"_ `mapDispatch`?

```notes
i think of it as the "original" mapDispatch

by right it's the "standard" way of doing it
- consistent signature with mapState
- receives exactly the same "treatment" internally, wrapping, optimization, binding, etc
  -> read "connectAdvanced", very interesting

but if you consider the declarativity of what `mapDispatch` API eventually brings us
this one feels more like an intermediate step
```

---

### with `bindActionCreators`

```jsx
import { bindActionCreators } from 'redux';

const increment = () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' })
const incrementBy = (num) => ({ type: 'INCREMENT_BY', num });

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) {
  return bindActionCreators({ increment, incrementBy }, dispatch)
};
```

same as

```jsx
//
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) {
  return {
    increment: () => dispatch(increment()),
    // it forwards all the parameters, too :D
    incrementBy: num => dispatch(incrementBy(num)),
  }
};
```

```notes
this convenient API is provided by Redux

what it does is that it takes the action providers you provide in the first parameter
and "bind" that with dispatch you provide in the second parameter

and since you gain access to `dispatch` in your `mapDispatch`, you should just pass that dispatch in
```

---

the ðŸ™Š _object shorthand_

```jsx
const mapDispatchToProps = { increment, incrementBy };
```

---

```jsx
const mapDispatchToProps = { increment, incrementBy };

const MyComponent = props => <div onClick={props.increment}>+</div>;
export default connect(
  null,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(MyComponent);
```

now `dispatch` is invisible to our whole app! ðŸ™Š

```notes
now even our `mapDispatch` function is not seeing "dispatch"
```

---

- declarative
- encapsulates logic talking to Redux so we donâ€™t have to worry about it

```notes
connectjs is essentially a hoc

what a hoc does is that it encapsulates some complex logic so its user don't have to worry about it

we write a lot ourselves too, with tracking, etc

it keeps its component "unaware" of redux, as we've seen, the component is completely unaware of "dispatch"

it's really doing a good job

it keeps _me_ unaware of Redux as well!
```
