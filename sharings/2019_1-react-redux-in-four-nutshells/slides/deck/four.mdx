### v6 Major Changes

- Uses [React's "New" Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- `withRef` replaced with `forwardRef`
- No longer supports passing `store` by `props`

```notes
if you don't use these
your apps should be fine
unless....
```

---

### Broken Libraries

- [Connected React Router](https://github.com/supasate/connected-react-router)
- [Redux Form](http://redux-form.com/)
- [React Redux Firebase](http://react-redux-firebase.com/)
- ...

### React Redux with React's New Context API

---

#### accessing `store`

```jsx
import { ReactReduxContext } from 'react-redux'

// in your connected component
render() {
  return (
    <ReactReduxContext.Consumer>
      {({ store }) => <div>{store}</div>}
    </ReactReduxContext.Consumer>
  )
}
```

---

#### Custom Context

```jsx
// provider
<Provider context={MyContext} store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

```jsx
// _AND_ connected components
export default connect(
  mapState,
  mapDispatch,
  null,
  {
    context: MyContext
  }
)(MyComponent);

// or
const ConnectedComponent = connect(
  mapState,
  mapDispatch
)(MyComponent);
<ConnectedComponent context={MyContext} />;
```

---

You need to supply the custom context in both `<Provider />` and in your connected components, otherwise you get runtime error

---

> Invariant Violation

> Could not find "store" in the context of "Connect(MyComponent)". Either wrap the root component in a , or pass a custom React context provider to and the corresponding React context consumer to Connect(Todo) in connect options.

---

It provides good isolation for multiple stores

```jsx
// a naive example

// there is no need to supply a default value when creating the context
// the value will be supplied when React-Redux mounts with your Context.Provider
const ContextA = React.createContext();
const ContextB = React.createContext();

// assuming reducerA and reducerB are proper reducer functions
const storeA = createStore(reducerA);
const storeB = createStore(reducerB);

// rendering
return (
  <Provider store={storeA} context={ContextA}>
    <Provider store={storeB} context={ContextB}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </Provider>
);
```

```notes
personal opinion

multiple store is never recommended

not redux's design intention

but there are "inadvisable position" where u may have to use it
```

---

It's also possible to chain `connect()`

```jsx
import { compose } from "redux";
import { connect } from "react-redux";

compose(
  connect(
    mapStateA,
    null,
    null,
    { context: ContextA }
  ),
  connect(
    mapStateB,
    null,
    null,
    { context: ContextB }
  )
)(MyComponent);
```
